## Description

I'm a big fan of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with my friends, so I decided to create this mini project using front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s a fully functional game featuring a color theme inspired by my favorite colors.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend.
- **Responsive design**: Works well on different screen sizes.
- **Simple interface**: Easy to navigate and play.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
2. Run the Live server or directly double click "index.html"
   It will automatically open the browser window with game init.
